I made a Contact Manager using the Kotlin programming language. This program allows users to add, view, edit, and delete contacts.
The user adds a name, a phone number, and email address to each contact they make. Then the program stores the data into a persistent JSON file.
So when the program is closed the data is stored to be able to be used later.

My purpose of making this project was to learn how to use the Kotlin programming language and to learn how to use a different IDE other 
than Microsoft's Visual Studio Code. (I have used VS Code for every single project except for this one).

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I used Intellij IDEA to write and run the program. I also used Gradle to help me use and manage libraries for my project. This helped me store my contacts into a JSON file to keep
my data persistent. 

The programming language I used is Kotlin. This is a programming language that runs on Java Virtual Machine and can be used with Java. Also, I used the kotlinx.serialization library to convert 
to a JSON file. I used it so the data was never deleted or lost when the program was shut off or not in use.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- I made a really easy way to see if users were adding emails and numbers and want to expand on that. To make sure the users are 
using actual emails and phone numbers.
- Make the user interface better and not just in the console. Making a graphical user interface or te program opens a website to use.
- Add more contacts methods. Maybe facebook and other socials and adding LinkedIn profiles that you can open with links.
